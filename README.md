ohawf

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Install

``` sh
pip install -U ohawf
```

Are you trying to log into Google Analytics, Search Console, or even
Google Photos from a Jupyter Notebook? Does all the advice telling you
to register as a developer and the mangled [Google
examples](https://developers.google.com/webmaster-tools/search-console-api-original/v3/quickstart/quickstart-python)
have you frustrated? Well then, ***ohawf*** may be fore you.

## How to use

``` python
import ohawf

creds = ohawf.get()
```

### Why So Easy?

Ohawf makes JupyterLab behave like an installed app. You know how Web or
Mobile apps can offer you the “Login with Google” option? Same thing.
This package makes JupyterLab work like an installed app. Perhaps you’d
like to know a little more?

### A Tale of 2 Installed App Flows

What makes ohawf work is this line:

``` python
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
```

#### The Old Way: Copy/Paste Token

InstalledAppFlow’s ***run_console()*** prompts you to copy/paste a token
from a browser tab to Jupyter and used to work well, but that approach
has been deprecated. It can still be forced to work, but it’s not so
easy.

#### The New Way: Gotta Have a Webserver

The new which is now the ohawf default is ***run_local_server()***. This
is what you encounter all the time with mobile apps when you see “Login
with Google”. An embedded browser pops up, goes through login, then
returns you to the mobile app. This works in Jupyter too. If you have
problems, run Jupyter <a href="https://mikelev.in/ux/">this way</a>. And
if you need to force ohawf to use run_console() for a server
installation, you can do this:

``` python
import ohawf
creds = ohawf.get(cli=True)
```

But then you’ll have to whitelist your email address, and you can only
do that through the [Goole Cloud
Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) so chicken-and-egg. If you
have to go that route, consider just registering as a Google developer
and downloading a OAuth Client secret json file like this:

- Go to <https://console.cloud.google.com>
- Make sure you’re in the correct Google account.
- Create a new Project.
- Go to API & Services.
- Enable the APIs & Services you want to use.
- Go to Credentials.
- Create a new OAuth 2.0 Client IDs of the Desktop App type.
- Go to OAuth consent screen and set it up.
- Go to +Add users, under test users (gets around tight security)
- Add the users for the test (your gmail, necessary even though already
  the app owner)
- Go back to Credentials and download OAuth Client.
  - Typically,
    ***client_secret\_\[secret\].apps.googleusercontent.com.json***
- Use that file with ohawf

Once you have the Client Secret JSON file, you can call ohawf like this:

``` python
import ohawf

creds = ohawf.get(file="client_secret.json")
```

### Adding Scopes

The ohawf package uses the following default scopes if you don’t set
any:

    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/webmasters.readonly
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/yt-analytics.readonly
    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/photoslibrary.readonly

If you want to set your own scopes, create a Python list of scopes and
feed it to ohawf:

``` python
creds = ohawf(scopes=scopes)
```

## Google Services

    from apiclient.discovery import build

Connect to Google services by giving ***build*** any (activated) API
name, version and credentials such listing your GSC sites:

    gsc_service = build('searchconsole', 'v1', credentials=cred)
    gsc_sites = gsc_service.sites().list().execute()
    [print(x['siteUrl']) for x in gsc_sites['siteEntry']];

…or this go list your GA accounts:

    ga_service = build('analytics', 'v3', credentials=cred)
    ga_accounts = ga_service.management().accounts().list().execute()
    [print((x['id'], x['name'])) for x in ga_accounts['items']];
