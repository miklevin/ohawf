    "Are you trying to log into Google Analytics, Search Console, or even Google Photos from a Jupyter Notebook? Does all the advice telling you to register as a developer and the mangled [Google examples](https://developers.google.com/webmaster-tools/search-console-api-original/v3/quickstart/quickstart-python) have you frustrated? Well then, ***ohawf*** is for you. Get the same \"Login as Google\" prompt in Jupyter that Mobile & Web apps use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import ohawf\n",
    "\n",
    "creds = ohawf.get()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why So Easy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ohawf makes JupyterLab behave like an installed app. You know how Web or Mobile apps can offer you the \"Login with Google\" option? Same thing. This package makes JupyterLab work like an installed app. Perhaps you'd like to know a little more?\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Tale of 2 Installed App Flows\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes ohawf work is this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Old Way: Copy/Paste Token\n",
    "InstalledAppFlow's ***run_console()*** prompts you to copy/paste a token from a browser tab to Jupyter and used to work well, but that approach has been deprecated. It can still be forced to work, but it's not so easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The New Way: Gotta Have a Webserver\n",
    "\n",
    "The new which is now the ohawf default is ***run_local_server()***. This is what you encounter all the time with mobile apps when you see \"Login with Google\". An embedded browser pops up, goes through login, then returns you to the mobile app. This works in Jupyter too. If you have problems, run Jupyter <a href=\"https://mikelev.in/ux/\">this way</a>. And if you need to force ohawf to use run_console() for a server installation, you can do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import ohawf\n",
    "creds = ohawf.get(cli=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But then you'll have to whitelist your email address, and you can only do that through the [Goole Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) so chicken-and-egg. If you have to go that route, consider just registering as a Google developer and downloading a OAuth Client secret json file like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)\n",
    "- Make sure you're in the correct Google account.\n",
    "- Create a new Project.\n",
    "- Go to API & Services.\n",
    "- Enable the APIs & Services you want to use.\n",
    "- Go to Credentials.\n",
    "- Create a new OAuth 2.0 Client IDs of the Desktop App type.\n",
    "- Go to OAuth consent screen and set it up.\n",
    "- Go to +Add users, under test users (gets around tight security)\n",
    "- Add the users for the test (your gmail, necessary even though already the app owner)\n",
    "- Go back to Credentials and download OAuth Client.\n",
    "  - Typically, ***client_secret_[secret].apps.googleusercontent.com.json***\n",
    "- Use that file with ohawf\n",
    "  \n",
    "Once you have the Client Secret JSON file, you can call ohawf like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import ohawf\n",
    "\n",
    "creds = ohawf.get(file=\"client_secret.json\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Scopes\n",
    "\n",
    "The ohawf package uses the following default scopes if you don't set any:\n",
    "\n",
    "    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets\n",
    "    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify\n",

    "    https://www.googleapis.com/auth/photoslibrary.readonly\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to set your own scopes, create a Python list of scopes and feed it to ohawf:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "creds = ohawf(scopes=scopes)\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Google Services\n",
    "\n",
    "    from apiclient.discovery import build\n",
    "    \n",
    "Connect to Google services by giving ***build*** any (activated) API name, version and credentials such listing your GSC sites:\n",
