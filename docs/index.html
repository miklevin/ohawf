<p>All Google services require this authentication and the difficulties are the biggest barrier for entry for newbs just getting started. If you have dreams of doing nifty Python with all your Google data (GA, GSC, GSheets, etc.) and have failed in the past over mere login issues, this package is for you. For example, ohawf simplifies the SEO-related processes described on their <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmaster-tools/search-console-api-original/v3/quickstart/quickstart-python">GSC API quickstart</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-use">How to use<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-to-use"> </a></h2>
<pre><code>import ohawf

credentials = ohawf.Get_Credentials()

</code></pre>
<p>Import ohawf and create a credentials object by calling the Get_Credentials() method of the package. You will immediately receive a link for the Web-based Google OAuth2 login prompt. If you're in Jupyter, you can just click it. If you're in Terminal, you can copy/paste it to the Browser address bar. When the Google OAuth2 login prompt appears, pick which account you want. Copy and paste the token it gives you into Jupyter or the terminal. You will know you're successful because you will see the printable string representation of the credentials object like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;google.oauth2.credentials.Credentials object at 0x000001C98D602580&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>Once you see that, congratulations! You are sitting on top of an authenticated credentials object that you can access and use in patterns like this for GSC:</p>

<pre><code># Retrieve list of Search Console sites
service = build('webmasters', 'v3', credentials=credentials)
gsc_sites = service.sites().list().execute()
[print(x) for x in gsc_sites]

</code></pre>
<p>...or this for GA:</p>

<pre><code># Retreive list of Google Analytics accounts
service = build('analyticsreporting', 'v3', credentials=credentials)
ga_accounts = service.management().accounts().list().execute()
[print(x) for x in ga_accounts]

</code></pre>
<p>Notice how clean this code is. Missing is all the authentication slop. It seems to be every documenter's favorite game to obfuscate Google Service examples, thus infuriating newbs and raising the bar to entry. Just as techology improves to make development fun and easy, other things like login become that much more difficult, apparently to maintain some comic balance. Maybe a right of passage.</p>
<h2 id="Become-a-Google-Developer">Become a Google Developer<a class="anchor-link" href="#Become-a-Google-Developer"> </a></h2><p>This ohawf package is ready to go. You can pip install it, or clone the Github repo. If you pip install it, you'll be using my Pipulate credentials.json from pip's site-package folder. This is fine, but you have to live with whichever API services I happen to enable through the Google Developers Console. In other words, you can only do stuff with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analytics Reporting</li>
<li>Chrome UX Report</li>
<li>Google Search</li>
<li>Google Analytics</li>
<li>Google Sheets</li>
<li>Gmail</li>
<li>PageSpeed Insights</li>
<li>YouTube Analytics             </li>
<li>YouTube Data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Google-Developers-Console">Google Developers Console<a class="anchor-link" href="#Google-Developers-Console"> </a></h2><p>If however you want to take control of your own destiny, using this login trick to perhaps to stuff with Google Photos, Big Query, Maps, or the Google Cloud Platform, you're going to want to replace the credentials.json file with your own. If you pip installed ohawf, then this is burried in pip's site-package folder and will be overwritten again with my own on every pip --upgrade. So git clone it instead, then go to the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/">Google Developers Console</a> and get your credentials.json.</p>
<p>If you switch from a pip install to a git clone, uninstall the pip version:</p>

<pre><code>pip uninstall ohawf

</code></pre>
<h2 id="Developers-Console-vs.-Cloud-Console">Developers Console vs. Cloud Console<a class="anchor-link" href="#Developers-Console-vs.-Cloud-Console"> </a></h2><p>The <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/">Google Developers Console</a> is the older and simpler version of the <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform</a>. You can probably use either one, but these instructions are for the GDC. You have to make at least 1 Project to get a credential file. From the Project you can click <em>Credentials</em> on the left-nav and create a new <em>OAuth 2.0 Client IDs</em> for <em>desktop</em> (middle option).</p>
<h2 id="OAuth-2.0-Client-IDs-(for-Desktop)">OAuth 2.0 Client IDs (for Desktop)<a class="anchor-link" href="#OAuth-2.0-Client-IDs-(for-Desktop)"> </a></h2><p>The ohawf package runs as a user account in a Desktop app so it can masquerade as you. While service accounts are nice (for never even needing to log in), they do not allow everybody to login as themselves and get access to their own Google data. The Desktop app credentials does allow this.</p>
<p>Download and rename your <em>OAuth 2.0 Client IDs</em> for <em>desktop</em> file to credentials.json. It should already have a .json extension. Drop the renamd file into the ohawf repo folder. If you're using Jupyter, it's fine to put it in the upper folder with the .ipynb files. If you're running from command-line, also put a copy of credentials.json in the nested ohawf folder.</p>

Since our lovely pandemic I got my butt back to Pennsylvania and am now the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd26IHBHcbtxD7pUdnIgiCw">Poconos Pythonista</a> focusing more on the type of data experimentation and automation folks are calling Data Engineering. Once upon a time, I worked for legendary Commodore Computers due to my love for their super ahead-of-its-time Amiga computer. Until recently everything paled in comparison. Finally I'm finding the love again using a certain mix of Linux, Python, vim and git (plus Jupyter and Virtual Desktops).
